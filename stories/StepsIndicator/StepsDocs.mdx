# Steps and Step Indicators

Used primarily to indicate the current step or inline page a user is on. We export both the individual `<Step/>` and `<StepsIndicator>`.

## Default, with 10 pages on page 6

<Canvas of={StepsStories.Default} />

## Attributes of the StepsIndicator

The attributes that can be passed through are listed below.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Attribute</td>
    <td>Type</td>
    <td>Default</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>selectedIndex</td>
    <td>`number`</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>length</td>
    <td>`number`</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>className</td>
    <td>`string`</td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>childClassName</td>
    <td>`string`</td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>props</td>
    <td>`any`</td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
</table>

An array of length `length` contains `<Step>` components, the colour of which is controlled by the `selected` data attribute (`true | false`). By default we use `selectedIndex` to point to the component that requires this attribute to be true. For higher customisability, we also include the `className` and `childClassName`. These respectively refer to the `<div>` containing all the Steps, and the `<Step/>` themselves.

For example, if you wanted the border of the `<div>` container to be grey, and the colour of the selected dot to be red, you would write:

```ts
<StepsIndicator length={5} selectedIndex={3} className="border-grey-300" childClassName="data-[selected=true]:text-red-600">
```
