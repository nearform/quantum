## Usage 

The 'primary' button type is used as athe main call to action on a screen. There may be more than one 'primary' button on screen , whenn intended actions are of equal importance, but it is usually preferable to introduce some hierarchy by using 'secondary' and/or 'tertiary ' buttons to perform less important/frequent actions, alongside the 'primary' button.
