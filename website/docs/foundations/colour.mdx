The Quantum colour system allows for clear defintions between functional elements with a focus on upholding  accessibility standards across light and dark mode.

## Base colour

The Base colour set forms a full colour palette made up 10 shades of 10 colours base colours provide colour values that are used by our alias colour variables, which are then assigned to our component styles, and other UI elements (Backgrounds, borders, text etc).

*Note* - Base colours are never applied directly to style components and UI elements.

## Alias colours 

The Alias colours are a set of colour tokens that inherit values from the base colours, establishing light and dark mode colours that can be applied directly to background and border properties of components, test and other UI elements.
